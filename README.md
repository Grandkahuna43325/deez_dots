# deez_dots
damn this is a lot of dots

#install:
git clone --recursive https://github.com/grandkahuna43325/deez_dots
cd deez_dots
chmod +x run.sh 
./run.sh

Run the run.sh file to source all of the dot files(you should do a back up before you do that!!!)

All of the env variables should be stored in ~/.env file!

And I think that's all. Have fun with the config!
